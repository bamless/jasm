# Jasm - J* cli in ASM

Jasm is a CLI tool for the [J*](https://github.com/bamless/jstar) programming language, implemented in assembly using [flat assembler](https://flatassembler.net/).
It was created primarily because I'm fucking bored and wanted to learn something new.
It is also a perfect excuse to procrastinate on my other projects.

## Compile

Install [fasm](https://flatassembler.net/), then `make`.  
You'll find the executable in `build/jasm`
